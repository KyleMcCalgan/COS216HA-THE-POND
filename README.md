TEST is a folder used to test a nodejs server 
currently you can use it to test out all of the API cases 
start the server by running the following:
    -make sure nodejs v20.19.1 is installed
    -install what ever additional pages dont work most likely:
        - npm install express http ws path axios body-parser readline cors
    -make sure xampp is running to make use of the API currently
    -run cd TEST
    -npm install
    -node server.js
    -follow instructions in terminal 



Testing branches, added a dev branch (as in development branch ) just to see the pull request stuff
